<br>

## 1. Create a Google form

## 2. Open the Script Editor
- Click " **‚ãÆ** " (aka Meatballs Menu).

## 3. Paste the following script given in the below file:
- [Google Form Response To Discord Script](google_script.js)

## 4. Create a webhook in the Discord channel you want the form results sent to
- This can be found by opening the channel settings (‚öô icon) and going to Webhooks.

## 5. Modify the specified values in the script
- Copy the webhook URL from the webhook you created into the script, replacing the "webhook_url".
- **NOTE**: Only text between double quotes (**""**) must be changed!
  - Change webhookUsername value if you want.
  - Set postTitle
  - Change embedColor value to whatever color you want or keep it as it is.
  - You can change the values of "Optional" field or keep it as it is (This is optional).

## 6. Test your code
- Save your file and then press the "**‚ñ∑ Run**" button to test your code.
- Make sure your form has at least 1 response. This test will always pull the last submitted response.

## 7. Add a Trigger
- Lastly, we need to add a trigger so this script is excecuted when a new form is submitted.
- On the left pane, click the "Triggers" icon that looks like an alarm clock, then press "Add Trigger".
- Make sure to set everything as shown in the image below.
